## Abstract
Make an open-source design for an airplace and ways to construct it

This is how far i can get in a car under 12 hours from a Brno  www.oalley.net/map/uhy

Flying over atlantic in single engine plane is not recommended.(?)

Experimental planes are relevant

## Perfect plane
Software
- Running open-source software written in rustlang/c++ with community of maintainers and contributors 
- Software should be 'super strict' on any error message assuming that all parts of the place would be monitored in set interval and procedure.

Hardware
- Expecting electric engine to cut down the cost of fuel and pollution
- Design should be sanitized -> If engine cuts off or halts the airplace should be able to safely glide down on a ground/float on the water with some options to dodge buildings etc..
- All parts should be indexed (have CAD to everything and exact specifications based on testing) and it's status monitored by a software to make sure that all parts are in working condition to avoid fatailities .
- optionally: solar panels on the top of the plane to passively charge, but i doubt it would be any good for overall range
- optionally: gas engine in case electric cuts off assuming that it fits in the maximmum weight of said design
- Radio should have a backup power and there should be backup of a radio so that i woudn't end up anywhere without radio contact.
